# XML Writing

I earned a certificate in XML Writing from Technical Writer HQ, where I gained hands-on experience with structured authoring and XML-based documentation.

As part of the course requirements, I completed a capstone project using Oxygen XML Editor.

For the project, I created a generic user manual for "Example Software," a fictional company. The manual, written in DITA XML, provides step-by-step instructions for navigating account settings and managing profile information.
