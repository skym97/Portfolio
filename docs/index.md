# Technical Writing Portfolio

-------------------------

## About Me

I am a technical writer currently working for a training company specializing in the public sector. My role has provided me with valuable experience in creating clear, detailed documentation for diverse audiences.

In addition to my technical writing experience, I have a background in retail, sales, and customer support, which has strengthened my ability to communicate effectively and adapt to different user needs.

I am passionate about continuing to build my skills and knowledge in technical writing, with a goal of establishing a long-term career in this field.

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my technical writing work from various classes and certificates I have completed.

Most of the projects featured in my portfolio come from three courses I completed through the University of Washington's Professional Continuing Education program. 
Two of these courses are specifically focused on technical writing.

Due to my current role in the public sector, I am unable to share professional writing samples due to confidentiality agreements (NDA). However, the work presented here demonstrates my technical writing skills and my commitment to delivering clear, effective documentation.
